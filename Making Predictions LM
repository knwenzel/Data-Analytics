# Create a linear regression model to predict the number of fawns from winter severity
m1 <- lm(formula=antelopedf$X1~antelopedf$X4, data=antelopedf)
summary(m1)
# With a Rsquared value of .54, we are led to believe that winter severity accounts for 54% of the varaibility of the number of fawns
# with a p-value less than .05, we can say the this test is statistcally significant, and the results are probably not due to randomness

# predict the number of fawns from winter severity and adult population
m2<- lm(formula=antelopedf$X1~antelopedf$X4+ antelopedf$X2, data=antelopedf)
summary(m2)
plot(m2)
# The adjusted Rsquared is .84, meaning 84% of the variability of baby fawns is due to winter severity and the adult population
# In this model, winter severity has a p-value greater than .05, so we would not say this is statistically significant, however
# the adult population is significant and is not due to randomness. 

# predict number of fawns from all three variables
m3<- lm(formula=antelopedf$X1~antelopedf$X4+ antelopedf$X2 + antelopedf$X3, data=antelopedf)
summary(m3)
# This model has the greatest adjusted rsquared value of the 3 at .95
# Each of the variables has a p-value below .05 meaning they are all statistically significant

## In conclusion, Model "M3" had the best results. With an adjusted Rsquared value of 95%, we can say that using the variables 
# winter severity, adult population, and annual precipitation, 95% of fawns variability is due to these factors. Each factor having
# a low p-value also shows us that each variable is statisically significant in the model.
